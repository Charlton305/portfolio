            <p className="">
              I'm Lee, an independent web developer from Sittingbourne, Kent,
              building professional websites and web apps for small businesses
              and independent professionals. I take pride in my work and the
              close relationships I build with my clients. Whether that means
              coding from scratch or using platforms such as Shopify and
              Webflow, I'll choose the best solution that fits your needs.

            <p className="">
              I keep things simple because simple works. Clean layouts, easy
              navigation and modern styling that doesn't get in the way of your
              message. No fancy tricks or confusing menus - just websites that
              look professional and make sense to your visitors. Your customers
              shouldn't have to think twice about how to use your site.

              Who I Work With
            </h3>
            <p>
              I work with all kinds of small businesses. Local pubs and
              restaurants looking to showcase their current menus and take
              bookings online. Construction companies who need to display their
              work and make it easy for customers to get in touch. Creative
              professionals building their portfolios. Really, any business
              owner who wants a website that works as hard as they do.
